<h2>Rewind</h2>
</p>

**Simple, automatic version control for solo developers**

Rewind automatically saves every version of your files when they change, giving you instant access to your entire editing history. Perfect for when you need to quickly restore a file after an overzealous AI agent, a bad refactor, or just want to see what your code looked like yesterday.

## Why Rewind?

- ðŸ”„ **Automatic**: No commits, no staging - just code and save
- âš¡ **Instant**: Restore any version of any file in seconds  
- ðŸŽ¯ **Solo-friendly**: Built for individual developers, not teams
- ðŸ’¾ **Local**: Everything stays on your machine
- ðŸ§  **Smart**: Ignores common files you don't want versioned (.git, node_modules, etc.)

## Install

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davenicholson-xyz/wallchemy/main/install.sh | bash
